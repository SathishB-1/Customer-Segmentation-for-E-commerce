# Customer Segmentation for E-Commerce using K-Means Algorithm

## Overview
Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy that helps businesses understand their customers better. This project implements customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers into segments based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer information, including:
- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Age
- Purchase Behavior (if applicable)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values
   - Normalizing numerical data
   - Feature engineering (if required)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing customer spending patterns
   - Identifying trends and distributions

3. **Applying K-Means Clustering**:
   - Finding the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method
   - Training the K-Means algorithm
   - Assigning customer segments

4. **Visualization of Clusters**:
   - Scatter plots to visualize customer segments
   - Interpreting segment characteristics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing K-Means clustering

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python customer_segmentation.py
   ```

## Results & Insights
The project successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their spending behavior and demographic characteristics. Businesses can use these insights to:
- Target high-value customers
- Develop personalized marketing strategies
- Improve customer retention

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing additional clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Using advanced feature selection techniques
- Deploying the model as a web application
